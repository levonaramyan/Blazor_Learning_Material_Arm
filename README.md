# Introduction to Blazor
Blazor is a framework for building interactive client-side web UI with .NET:
  - Create rich interactive UIs using C# instead of JavaScript.
  - Share server-side and client-side app logic written in .NET.
  - Render the UI as HTML and CSS for wide browser support, including mobile browsers.
Using .NET for client-side web development offers the following advantages:
  - Write code in C# instead of JavaScript.
  - Leverage the existing .NET ecosystem of .NET libraries.
  - Share app logic across server and client.
  - Benefit from .NET's performance, reliability, and security.
  - Stay productive with Visual Studio on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
  - Build on a common set of languages, frameworks, and tools that are stable, feature-rich, and easy to use.
